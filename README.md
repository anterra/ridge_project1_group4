# Metis Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis for MTA Turnstile Data

The group is tasked with optimizing the placement of street teams around New York City subway stations, to gather contact information for an annual fall gala held by WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY). 

The goals of the client are: (1) to fill the seats for the event with individuals passionate about increasing participation of women in tech and who many donate to the cause, and (2) to build awareness and reach for WTWY.
